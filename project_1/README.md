Background and Data Source:

This dataset is provided by Urban Ministries of Durham who connect with the community to end homelessness and fight poverty by offering food, shelter and a future to neighbors in need. This data contains 18 columns, including the information of data, client ID and the amount of different kinds of help they provide for different clients. 


Questions to answer:

1. Show the change over time for:
*(1) the number of bus tickets
(2) Food Pounds
(3) Clothing Items
(4) Diapers
(5) School Kits
(6) Hygiene Kits
*(7) Financial Support
by plots to determine which needs are increasing/decreasing over time to make UMD better prepare for the items.

* are not provided any more, but could still be shown.

2. Show whether there are any difference in the number of people coming for help and the needs of other items after stopping providing for bus tickets & Financial Support.
# Note: Didn’t look through the data and don’t know whether it’s possible to do that.

3. Determine the clients coming most often by grouping data by Client File Number to find those who need help most.

4. Find:
(1) whom have contributed to UMD financially
(2) what type of bills people have to pay
by sorting data by corresponding column and then unique the column.

5. Show how the number of people that food provide for affects the needs of other help (If possible).

Three useful variables:
 
Date
Client File Number
Food Provided for

Possible analysis approach:
1. Association Test: Test the association between “food provide for” and other variables.  

2. (If applicable) (General) Linear regression: (“food provide for” as the explanatory variable, and other variables such as “clothes items” as response variable).
