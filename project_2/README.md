## The overall information about the project

The project 2 is a continuity of my project 1. In project 1, I have shown

1. The trend of the change for different variables over time (basically from 2005 till now). We focused on variables ‘Food pounds’ and ‘clothing items’ mostly.

2. Who have contributed to UMD financially and what types of bill people have to pay.

3. The relationships between number of people served and food pounds, clothing items, and the average amounts that per person served per visit need.

4. Specific analysis for some families/people.

Correspondingly, in the project 2, I will show:

1. The trend of the change for different variables that people choose over time (from 2005 till now).

2. The relationships between number of people served and food pounds/clothing items (people could choose which variable they have interests), and the average amounts that per person served per visit need.

3. The specific analysis for each client chosen by people.
