## Background and Data Source

These datasets are from the shelter side of Urban Ministries of Durham(UMD) who connects with the community to end homelessness and fight poverty by offering food, shelter and a future to neighbors in need. The datasets consist of 16 tables, including information about clients upon entry to and exit from the shelter, such as basic demographics, income, insurance, etc. 

The datasets are available here: https://github.com/biodatascience/datasci611/tree/gh-pages/data/project2_2019

## Questions

1. Summary statistics of people entering shelter (such as age, gender, race, etc.).

2. Trend of the number of people who were in the shelter.

3. Was there any significant improvement about people's lives after staying in the shelter for a while?

4. Specific analysis to each client to track their entries and exits activities.

## Analysis Approaches

1. Using python to pre-processing data.

2. Using R to plot the trends.

3. Using Docker to create an environment with both python and R.

4. Using Make file to run all the codes.
